## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Who are we?
We are RusherVace.NET! A Minecraft Bedrock Edition server that specialises in mini-games.

# What do we do?
The biggest task of the RusherVace.NET team is to support the players, to make their wishes come true and to offer them a fantastic gaming experience.
If there are any problems, you can easily report them and we will try to help as soon as possible.

Criticism is something we need to improve. That's why it's always good to leave feedback. Especially if you don't like something.

Our eye is on the individual player and not on the mass. 

# What can I do?
You can help us. You can do this by giving us feedback, telling us your wishes and playing on our server.


We wish you lots of fun and enjoyment! ðŸ‘‹
